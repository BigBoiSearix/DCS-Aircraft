The A-4 is a lightweight, subsonic, single-engine attack aircraft developed for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps by the Douglas Aircraft Company. originally designated A4D under the U.S. Navy's pre-1962 designation system, and entering service in 1956, it was designed to deliver conventional and nuclear weapons in daytime visual flight conditions. However, using the APG-53A radar first installed on the A-4C, the A-4 is capable of all-weather navigation at low altitudes, as well as limited computer-assisted weapon delivery. Almost 3000 were built between 1954 and 1979.
